An open source java ATM Host Simulator based upon
JPOS Q2 framework

Nothing to release so far, help make it happen faster and
contribute



# Details #

Hi,

For those of us that work in the payment system industry we know
it'll make our life a hell lot easier if we have an open source
solution for ATM management that handles NDC and diebold.

Now my plan is to develop

1. ATM Host Controller + Switch bridge to ISO8583

2. State/Screen Builder


I can't do it alone, need volunteers to help me with this.


I'm working on the host controller, perhaps somebody
could work on a WYSIWYG state/screen builder ?

Anyway contact me at hairi@m-sinergi.com
